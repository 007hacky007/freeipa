API chages before January 2009 simi-freeze:

  * Merge Param and Type together so that rather than taking the type as a
    kwarg, you simply use the Type. For example, instead of:
        >>> Param('number', type=Int())
    You would do this:
        >>> Int('number')
    The types will correspond to Python 3.0 text/binary disambiguaiton, so we
    will have Bytes, Str, Int, Float, and Bool.

  * Rename crud Method base classes to standard CRUDS name: Add=>Create,
    Get=>Retrieve, Mod=>Update, Del=>Delete, Find=>Search.

  * Add a Command.backend convenience attribute that checks if the class
    uses_backend attribute is sets the Command.backend attribute like this:
        self.backend = self.Backend[self.uses_backend]

  * Finish methods on Plugin base class for calling external commands via
    subprocess.

  * Probably renamed ipa_server package to ipaserver.

  * Add special logging methods to Plugin baseclass for authorization events
    (escalation, de-escalation, and denial).

  * Implement gettext service.

  * Add ability to register pre-op, post-op plugins per command.

  * Add ability to have certain args/options only active on either client-side
    or server-side, and also the same for things like default_from callbacks.

  * Add ability to have a post-processing step that only gets called
    client-side.  It should have a signature like output_for_cli() minus the
    textui argument.  Need to decide whether we allow this method to modify
    the return value.

CLI
  - Prompt for password using getpass
  - Passed the param dict to output_for_cli()
  - Implement a TextUI class and also pass it to output_for_cli()

Improve ease of plugin writting
  - make "from ipalib import *" import everything a plugin writter will need
  - Finish ipa_types, add Str and Float Types

Packaging
  - Use setuptools instead of plain distutils
  - Make setup.py generate dev-docs and run unit tests
  - Package for rpm (.spec file)
  - Package for apt (debian/ dir)

Migration
  - Add the IPAService objectclass to existing principals
  - Move existng host/ principals from cn=services to cn=computers?
