You can collect the template pot file by running the following command:

~/ipa-server/ipa-gui$ tg-admin i18n collect

which creates locales/messages.pot. However, unfortunately, the above
command doesn't work correctly for .kid files unless you apply the
patch i18n.patch.

If you add a new language translation remember to add the name to
LINGUAS in Makefile.am.
