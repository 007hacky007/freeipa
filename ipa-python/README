This is a set of libraries common to IPA clients and servers though mostly
geared currently towards command-line tools.

A brief overview:

aci.py - a basic LDAP ACI parser for doing delegations.
config.py - identify the IPA server domain and realm. It uses dnsclient to
            try to detect this information first and will fall back to
            /etc/ipa/ipa.conf if that fails.
ipaadminutil.py - routines to help reduce the number of entries from a search
dnsclient.py - find IPA information via DNS

ipaclient.py - the main interface for any command-line tools. When initialized
               if transport is True then it means the IPA server is on the
               same machine so no need to use the XML-RPC interface.
rpcclient.py - the XML-RPC client API. Callers should use ipaclient instead
               of this directly.

ipautil.py - helper functions

radius_util.py - helper functions for Radius

user.py
group.py
entity.py - entity is the main data type. User and Group extend this class
            (but don't add anything currently).

ipavalidate.py - basic data validation routines
ipaerror.py - our own error types
krbtransport.py - do Kerberos auth over HTTP/S
