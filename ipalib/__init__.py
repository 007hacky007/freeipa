The IPA Library.

To learn about the ``ipalib`` library, you should read the code in this order:

    1. Learn about the plugin framework in `ipalib.plugable`

    2. Learn about the public API in `ipalib.public`

    3. Look at some example plugins in `ipalib.plugins.example`

Some of the plugin architecture was inspired by ``bzr``, so you might also
