These tools are designed for administrators to work from a command-line,
use in scripts, etc.

The design goal is to provide 100% of capabilities that the UI has, something
which is often not true.

Developers
----------

These scripts use an XML-RPC interface to communicate with the IPA server.
Please use only this API and avoid the temptation to communicate directly
with the LDAP server. It is our philosophy to have a robust, standard
interface for doing all IPA administrative work.
